Choco lava cake is a popular dessert that combines the elements of a chocolate cake and a souffl√©. Its name derives from the dessert's liquid chocolate center,and it is also known as chocolate moelleux, chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake. It should not be confused with chocolate fondant, a recipe that contains little flour, but much chocolate and butter, hence melting on the palate.
